## Getting Started

At the AI Club, we're committed to tailoring your experience to your skill level and interests. When you join our club, we'll assess your AI knowledge and ensure that you're placed in a project that suits your expertise.

### Knowledge Assessment

To help us understand your AI background, we'll conduct a brief knowledge assessment \(discussion based\). This helps us determine your skill level and ensures that you get the most out of your membership.

### Project Assignments

Here's how we assign projects:

- **Newbies**: If you're new to AI or have limited experience, we'll assign you to one of our ongoing projects. This is a fantastic way to learn from experienced members, gain practical skills, and contribute to ongoing initiatives in a supportive environment.

- **Experienced Members**: If you already have a solid foundation in AI or related fields, we'll encourage you to take on a separate project. You can explore your own ideas, innovate, and lead a project that aligns with your interests and expertise. We're here to support your individual growth and encourage your leadership.
